In this project we created a website using Node Express for backend, Node Next.js for frontend,Mongodb + Prisma ORM for database and Cloudnay for image and file storage. Kaio was the one responsible for all the UI UX choices and some of the frontend development. I was responsible for the backend, some frontend, database and integration of the features being planed. In this project i used the codebase developed in my company "Cubic" to accelerate the development with great success, but still, a lot of features had to be custom made for this specific project. The project is currently stoped and with no prevision to be resumed.

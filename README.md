In this project we created a website using Node Express for backend, Node Next.js for frontend,Mongodb + Prisma ORM for database and Cloudnay for image and file storage. 
Kaio was the one responsable for all the UI UX choices and some of the frontend development. I was responsable for the backend, some forntend, database and inegration of the features being planed.
In this project i used the codebase developed in my company "Cubic" to accelerate the development with great succes, but still, a lot of features had to be custom made for this specific project.
The project is currently stoped and with no prevision to be resumed.
